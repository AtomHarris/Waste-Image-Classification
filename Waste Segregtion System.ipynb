    "## Overview/Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Konza City Technopolis is a burgeoning smart city in Kenya, designed to be a hub of technology, innovation, and sustainability. As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, Konza City aims to implement advanced waste management solutions. iDump, a waste management company, has been contracted to develop and deploy an efficient waste segregation system that separates waste into different categories for recycling. This initiative will play a crucial role in maintaining the city’s cleanliness, reducing environmental impact, and promoting recycling practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid waste encompasses all materials that result from human and societal activities but have lost their utility or desirability. This waste may be items belonging to three primary groups:\n",
    "- **Recyclable Inorganics:** Fit for repurposing, e.g., plastics, metals.\n",
    "- **Divertible Organics:** From which energy and fertilizer can be derived, e.g., food and vegetation.\n",
    "- **Inorganic Materials Requiring Landfill:** E.g., ceramics, treated wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improper management of waste disposal poses significant risks to environmental sustainability and human health, resulting from toxic wastewater byproducts and the global warming potential of methane in landfill gas. In 2020, 3.48% of global greenhouse gas production was attributed to the waste disposal sector, with methane from landfill gases accounting for 20% of worldwide methane emissions the following year. The chemical composition and production of both wastewater and landfill gases heavily depend on the organic content within the waste processed, with significant variations arising in the presence of food and vegetation materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection of the waste types under meticulously refined material classes in both an accurate and timely manner is essential for sustainable waste management, ensuring accountability for both seasonal variations and recycling uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "![Problematic Garbage Disposal](Images/landfill.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Konza City Technopolis faces significant challenges in managing the diverse and large volume of waste generated by its residents and businesses, projected to peak at 240,000 inhabitants. Traditional waste management methods, reliant on manual sorting and segregation, have proven to be inefficient, labor-intensive, and unable to cope with the scale of waste produced. This inefficiency has led to increased environmental pollution, with a substantial portion of waste being improperly disposed of in landfills or open dumps, contributing to soil contamination, water pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the lack of effective segregation and recycling facilities hampers the city’s ability to recycle valuable materials, leading to significant loss of resources and economic opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we propose developing and deploying a robust image recognition system utilizing machine learning algorithms. The system will be trained on a diverse dataset of waste images and evaluated based on its accuracy and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics of Success:\n",
    "- **Model Accuracy:** We aim for at least 80% accuracy in waste classification.\n",
    "- **F1 Score:** We’ve set a target F1 score of 0.75 or higher to balance precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "- **Diverse Waste Composition:** The waste generated in Konza City includes a wide variety of materials, making it challenging to accurately classify each type.\n",
    "- **Data Quality:** Ensuring the dataset used for training the model is comprehensive and representative of real-world waste conditions.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle large volumes of waste efficiently, potentially requiring integration with conveyor belt systems for real-time processing.\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in waste classification to ensure the effectiveness of recycling processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Objective:** Develop and deploy a robust image recognition system to enhance waste management efficiency in Konza City.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Gather and preprocess a diverse dataset of waste images to ensure robust model training, including various types and conditions of waste items.\n",
    "2. Analyze and report the most common types of waste collected.\n",
    "3. Accurately classify waste into their distinct material types and categorize them into recyclable inorganics, divertible organics, and non-recyclable inorganic materials to improve waste management.\n",
    "4. Deploy a user-friendly interface that allows iDump personnel/equipment to upload images and receive real-time classification results from the image recognition model.\n",
